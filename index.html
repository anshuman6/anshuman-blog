Hi and welcome to my Blog. As a quick itroduction, my name is Anshuman Gupta and I use this platform to blog about my interest and hobby - coding, ML and AI. Professionally, I am not a coder, I am working in business consulting for about 8 years now. Right now, I am helping a boutique consulting firm develop business in the North Amercian markets, specially focussing on strategy consulting for R and D teams.

I find learning new technologies, tinkering with code very exciting and in some sense calming and therapeutic! Also, it helps me in my consulting job, where I can better connect with my clients who are usually senior R and D leaders, working on the cutting edge.

You can read more about me on my main webpage, anshumang.com

Also, happy to connect on LinkedIn where I am usually pretty active, link on my main page.
